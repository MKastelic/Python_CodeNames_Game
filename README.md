# Python_CodeNames_Game

Based on the popular party game "CODENAMES" by Vlaada Chvatil, this electronic version crafted in Python replaces the static cardboard spymaster key card with a small mobile or tablet device running a web browser to provide a dynamic "decoder" during game play.

Untethered, by a static key, several optional variants (see [New Rules](Assets/CodeName_New_Rules.pdf)) have been added to make this game even more fun and challenging:

1. **Spy Swaps** - allow spymasters a limited number of opportunities to exchange codenames between their team's and the opposing team's agents.
2. **Mole** - at a selected rate, new codenames randomly replace existing blue or red agents.
3. **Double Agents** - allow spymaster a limited number of opportunities to denote an opposing team's agent as a double agent and obtain credit if contact is made by the opposing team in their next turn.
  
To enable the program to provide real time updates to the browser, access to a web page with FTP connectivity is required. At the start of the program, a dialog window opens and allows FTP account settings to be entered.

The assets directory posted in this public repository, contains generic images for code word card stock, agents, bystanders, and the assassin. However, with access to the original game, scanning images of the game pieces to identically named GIF files, provides a more attractive and familiar game experience. Note: source images should be about 270x185 pixels (WxH) for optimum display at 1920x1200 screen resolution. As images are automatically resized by the program to accommodate various screen sizes, the aspect ratio should be kept proportional to the source image dimensions noted above.
